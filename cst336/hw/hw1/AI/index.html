                 <p>While we continuously excel in the field of computer science, human body and mind has its 
                 constraints. Our brain is too slow to react to sudden changes, collect and analyze vast amounts 
                 of data and our bodies cannot survive without food or water, in harsh environments from the depth 
                 of the oceans to outer space. Artificial Intelligence can make lives better in a variety of areas 
                 such as transportation using smart cars, medical field by collection and analyzing vast amounts of 
                 data to provide a correct diagnosis, go beyond the limits of human body in deeper space to help us 
                 understand the universe even better. Like we have seen on jeopardy WATSON is IBMâ€™s attempt at AI. 
                 Few of the major corporations and or organizations that are conducting research in multiple area of 
                 Artificial Intelligence are Google, IBM, Apple, Facebook and Amazon.</p>
