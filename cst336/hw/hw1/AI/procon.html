                 <p>Artificial Intelligence does have its advantages and disadvantages. How many 
                 times we have seen or heard from the media like television, movies and even news, 
                 that when computer will take over the world it will be the end for humanity but 
                 whether or not Artificial Intelligence is a threat to the humanity depends upon 
                 what we design it for. One of the main advantage is that it can go where no human 
                 can “ Taking risks on behalf of humans - With artificial intelligence, you can 
                 arguably lessen the risks you expose humans to in the name of research. Take, for 
                 example, space exploration and the Mars rover, known as Curiosity. It can travel 
                 across the landscape of Mars, exploring it and determining the best paths to take, 
                 while learning to think for itself. Using artificial intelligence in this manner 
                 could potentially lead to massive benefits in areas such as demand forecasting, 
                 medical diagnosis and oil exploration.” (Ruocco, K. 2017) Now on the other hand I 
                 know a lot of people have already suffered through this, as I also come from the 
                 manufacturing that automation takes away jobs. This is one of the main disadvantages 
                 of AI, according to a report “Up to 800 million global workers will lose their jobs 
                 by 2030 and be replaced by robotic automation, a new report from a consultancy has 
                 found.” (Robot automation will 'take 800 million jobs by 2030, 2017) I plan on working 
                 in this field to improve the quality of our daily lives by avoiding accidents, reducing 
                 time spent in traffic and more with family, and by providing accurate diagnosis. </p>
