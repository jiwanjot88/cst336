                 <p>Field of Artificial intelligence is definitely growing and will expand in many 
                 different areas. Among others some of the trends in the coming year in the field of 
                 Artificial Intelligence will be AI start-ups, Integration of AI with mobile or web 
                 applications, more electronics powered by AI, etc. (Oberoi, A. 2017) Artificial 
                 Intelligence helped researchers at John Hopkins University to suggest that people with 
                 cancer who have certain types of cellular receptors will respond better to some 
                 immunotherapy vaccines and drugs. (John Hopkins Medicine, 2018) There is a huge demand 
                 for machine learning engineer, data scientist and software developer, etc.</p>
